            ðŸ’Œ A Message from Fad Cri
          </Title>
          <Text>
            Thank you for choosing my home-based nail studio. I&apos;m a private nail technician who
            truly values creativity, collaboration, and the trust of every client I work with.
          </Text>

          <Text>
            I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but in order to provide you
            with the best possible service, I kindly ask for your full cooperation in following the
            studio policies. For the comfort, safety, and focus of both client and technician, I
            unfortunately cannot allow companions or children inside the studio. This helps maintain
            a calm and distraction-free environment where I can give you the attention and quality
            you deserve.
          </Text>

            Please arrive on time or at least 10 minutes early. Late arrivals may affect the
            schedule, as I allot dedicated time for each client. Your understanding and cooperation
            mean so much.
